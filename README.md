A collection of iPython Notebooks for various things. Will add more details and more notebooks as time goes by.

Note: the TOSCA notebook requires jinja2, tornado, and pyzmq packages. 
All of which may be installed with the
 	pip install <package> command.

The MODIS_Veg notebooks are to use the 16-day MOD13Q1 data.
